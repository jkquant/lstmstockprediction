# lstmstock_forexprediction
Bidirectional long/short strategy using LSTM Stock/Forex Price forecast

A price prediction strategy framework for trading financial instruments.
Creates technical analys and signal processing as features to feed an LSTM Neural Network model.
In this example we predict the percent change in exchange rate within 1hr in EUR/USD instrument. The dataset can be resampled to predict movement in higher timeframes. 

## TODO
- Explore feature selection (rfe) and feature extraction (pca) to improve performance
- Convert Predictions to trade Signals
- Compute returns metrics

## Files:
- File1 = features.py
- File2 = feature_selection.py
- File1 = lstm_hyperparameter.py
- File2 = lstm_prediction_model.py

## Folder: pricedata
- default EUR/USD Market data in hourly candles
- default feature selection for this example, generated by running feature_selection.py
